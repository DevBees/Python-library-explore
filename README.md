# Python-mini-projects
Some interesting python programs(not the basics).


Import required libraries.

Useful short programs.

Implementable on programs.

All required libraries must be installed before running the program

Usually pip install libraryname works but its better to search the web.

Some of them might be pre-installed if you're using anaconda
